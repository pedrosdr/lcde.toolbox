\title{Add Largest Variations to PCA Scatter Plot}
\usage{
pcaviz.add_largest_variations(
  this,
  number,
  keys,
  years,
  labels = NULL,
  variation = "positive"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{this}{A PCA visualization object of class 'pcaviz'.}

\item{number}{An integer specifying the number of largest variations to visualize.}

\item{keys}{A vector of keys (variables) for which the largest variations are to be identified.}

\item{years}{A vector of years corresponding to the data points being analyzed.}

\item{labels}{(Optional) A vector of labels for each key, used for annotation in the plot.
If NULL, defaults to an empty string.}

\item{variation}{A character string indicating whether to visualize 'positive' or 'negative' variations.}
}
\value{
A modified PCA visualization object with segments and labels added for the largest variations.
}
\description{
This function identifies and visualizes the largest variations in a PCA scatter plot
by adding segments and labels for specified keys over a range of years.
It helps in understanding how certain variables have changed significantly
across the specified time frame, either positively or negatively.
}
\details{
The function first checks that the input object is valid. It then retrieves
the largest variations using the \code{pca.get_largest_variations} helper function.
The results are printed and subsequently visualized by adding segments and labels
to the PCA plot. The segments are colored based on whether they represent positive
or negative variations.
