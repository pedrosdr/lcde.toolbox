\usage{
pcaviz.explained_variance(pca_obj, size = vizsize())
}
\arguments{
\item{pca_obj}{An object of class \code{pca}, which contains PCA results including
explained variance and component names. The object must have a valid
structure as expected by the pcaviz package.}

\item{size}{(Optional) A vizsize, character or numeric value that determines the size of the plot elements.
Defaults to the value returned by \code{vizsize()}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the bar plot of explained variance for each PCA component.
The plot includes:
- Bars indicating the percentage of variance explained.
- Labels displaying the explained variance formatted to two decimal places.
}
\description{
Generates a bar plot showing the percentage of explained variance for each PCA component.
}
\details{
This function visualizes the proportion of variance explained by each principal component
in a PCA analysis. It creates a bar plot where the height of each bar represents
the percentage of variance explained by the corresponding component.

The function checks if the provided \code{pca_obj} is valid. It then creates a bar plot using
\code{geom_col()} to represent the explained variance for each principal component.
The y-axis is formatted to show percentages.

The function uses:
\itemize{
\item \code{theme_light()} for a clean background theme.
\item \code{scale_y_continuous()} to format y-axis labels as percentages.
}
}
